# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## üìå Overview
This task implements **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models for classification.  
We use the **Breast Cancer dataset** from scikit-learn, train Linear and RBF kernel SVMs, perform cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualize decision boundaries.  

The project is written in Python and tested in **VS Code**.
